### Short Bio
Hi! I'm Daijun, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Optical Engineering at Zhejiang University under the guidance of [Prof. Jianjun He](https://mypage.zju.edu.cn/JianjunHe#0). Alongside my major, I have developed a keen interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My current research focuses on the integration of Optics and AI. In the future, I am eager to pursue a Ph.D. degree in the field of AI, with a particular focus on areas of 3D Vision tasks. Now, my research interests mainly focus on 3D objects/scenes generation and reconstruction from single-view images or others guidance. I am delighted to by supervised by and work with [Prof. Yiyi Liao](https://yiyiliao.github.io/) in ZJU. Since October 2023, I started to be a research intern at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), focus on End-to-End design for optics and algorithms.
